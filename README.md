# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **medical insurance charges** based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region using the **Medical Insurance Cost Dataset**. We implemented several regression models and performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to gain insights into the data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, handling categorical variables using label encoding, and transforming features for model input.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations to understand distributions, relationships, and correlations between variables.
  - Boxplots, histograms, and bar charts were used to illustrate key insights.
- **Model Training**:
  - Compared several regression models, including **Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, K-Neighbors Regressor**, and **Decision Tree Regressor**.
  - Hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model to achieve the best performance.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Models were evaluated using **R-squared**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** metrics.

## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression (LR)**
- **Random Forest Regressor (RF)**
- **Decision Tree Regressor (DT)**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)**
- **K-Neighbors Regressor (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

## Dependencies

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
